After studying Computer Engineering at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, he joined Xing Technology where he shaped the MP3 efforts and then spent time for the dot com boom on EMusic’s FreeAmp team. While at EMusic he started working on MusicBrainz, the open music encyclopedia, and fell in love with Open Source software.</p>
      <p>Robert is also an active hardware hacker, creating art projects for Burning Man and Nowhere. He is the co-founder of <a href="http://partyrobotics.com">Party Robotics</a> where he co-created Bartendro the open source cocktail robot.</p>

      <h4><strong>Senior Developer</strong> - Michael Wiencek | bitmap</h4>
      <p>A bitmap is a type of memory organization or image file format used to store digital images. The term bitmap comes from the computer programming terminology, meaning just a map of bits, a spatially mapped array of bits. Now, along with pixmap, it commonly refers to the similar concept of a spatially mapped array of pixels. Raster images in general may be referred to as bitmaps or pixmaps, whether synthetic or photographic, in files or memory.

      <h4><strong>Community Manager</strong> - Frederik S. Olesen | Freso</h4>
      <p>Hired in the fall of 2015 as the MetaBrainz Community Manager, Freso is in charge of most of the public communication channels (IRC, forums, blog, etc.) and various community projects (like the Google Code-in). He has been a <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/user/Freso">MusicBrainz contributor since 2006</a> and an open source enthusiast for even longer.</p>
      <p>On the rare occasions that he is not found in front of a monitor of some sort, Freso can be found <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/artist/d112e7ac-3811-4773-abe3-f06c5e697ff4">playing music</a> or (far more commonly) dancing to it. He has even taught some dance classes and workshops in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-boying">b-boying</a>!</p>
      <p>Freso was born, raised, and is still living in Copenhagen, Denmark but is currently working toward moving to Barcelona.</p>

She has professional degrees in architecture from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>, and law from the <a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/">University of Calgary</a>.</p>

      <p>A zealous music devotee, Laurent Monin first stumbled upon MusicBrainz and Picard in attempts to codify his vast collection of over 1500 CDs. In addition to being a music fanatic, Laurent has been programming on anything with more than 1 bit since 1982 and has been an esteemed Linux system administrator since 1998.</p>
      <p>With his extensive repertoire of skills and passions, Laurent has actively contributed to a myriad of open source projects, notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELinks">ELinks</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geeqie">Geeqie</a>, and loves to tinker with the hardware of various audio gadgets, including amplifiers and loudspeakers. However, Laurent's contributions do not end there. He currently sustains the MetaBrainz servers while residing near Besançon, France.</p>
